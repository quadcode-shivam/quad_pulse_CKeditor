# Quad Pulse CKEditor

This project is a learning experiment where I've integrated CKEditor (a rich text editor) into a React application. The goal is to understand how to use CKEditor in React, customize it, and implement its features. While the project is still in progress, it provides a basic implementation that you can build upon.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Allows users to create and edit content using a rich text editor.
- **Toolbar Customization**: Basic toolbar options are set up, with potential for further customization.
- **React Integration**: CKEditor is integrated into React as a controlled component.
- **Learning Purpose**: This project is aimed at understanding how CKEditor works with React and will be extended over time.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Editor**: CKEditor 5
- **Tools**: Node.js, npm
